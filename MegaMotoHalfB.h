 * \brief    H-Bridge configuration -- An Arduino
 *           library to control the MegaMoto motor
 *           controller family by Robot Power
 *
 * The MegaMotoHalfB class is a derived class from
 * the MegaMotoBase base class. You should use the
 * MegaMotoHalfB class if your device is wired
 * in a half-bridge configuration (hence the
 * "HalfB" at the end of the class name). If
 * You do not know what this means, then you
 * probably haven't checked out the MegaMoto
 * User Guide written by the people who made
 * it, Robot Power! Go have a look first. Things
 * over here might make more sense afterwards.
 * Trust me.
